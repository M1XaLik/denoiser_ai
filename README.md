# COURSEWORK GROUP PROJECT

This project implements a web application based on Flask that allows users to upload noisy photos. The artificial intelligence (AI) built on TensorFlow and Keras will process these photos to remove the noise. The photo data and results are stored in a SQLite database for further analysis and storage. This project was created by computer science students.
